# Gradient-Descent-implementation

This repo contains implementation of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent optimization techniques for logitic regression.

**data.txt**
- Input dataset for the implementation

**data_utils.py**
- Base code with implementations for drawing the hyperplane seperator and plotting it

**logistic_regression.py**
- Performs gradient descent and plots negative log-likelihood curve for learning rate 0.5

**logistic_regression_mod.py**
- Performs gradient descent and plots negative log-likelihood curve for different learning rates

**logistic_regression_sgd.py**
- Performs stochastic gradient descent and plots negative log-likelihood curve for different learning rates

**logistic_regression_sgd_2.py**
- Performs stochastic gradient descent using random sampling and plots negative log-likelihood curve for different learning rates

Folders **plots**, **plots-mod**, **plots-sgd** contain visualizations.

**For execution:**
